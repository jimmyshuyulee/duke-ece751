In this short assignment you will be adding
constructor functions to the Vector2D class
you previously defined.

Your only task is to modify your class in
vector.hpp to have two different constructors,
described below.

  1. Define the default constructor. Set both x and y to 0.
  2. Define a constructor that takes in two arguments
     representing the x and y coordinates of the
     vector.
