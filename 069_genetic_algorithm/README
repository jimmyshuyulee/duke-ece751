In this assignment you will be writing a parallelized genetic algorithm
to perform evidence based scheduling. There are stubs to implement in both
fitness.cpp and ga.hpp. For a detailed introduction on what you are doing,

Note the specification carefully as it is not identical to what is in the

to accomplish this task. Use the 'ln' command to create symbolic links to
those files.
