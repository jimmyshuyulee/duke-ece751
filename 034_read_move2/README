Consider the code in the enclosed file, "code.cpp".

In the file you will find 3 classes - IPAddress, Header
and Packet. A header holds 2 IP's for the source and
destination and each packet has a header.

What would the output of the code be?
Think carefully about what happens when the move 
constructor is invoked.
Put the output in a file called "answer.txt"
