Thank you for submitting random story!
This assignment is not yet due, so we aren't grading it yet.
However, we will do some basic sanity checking to avoid careless mistake..
You have a Makefile--great!
Trying to run 'make'
gcc -o rand_story -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 main.o
make succeeded--great!
make produced rand_story---great!
Trying to the testcase in the README to sanity check your output...
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Your file matched the expected output
You have the same output on the textcase in the README
NOTE: you should do your own more extensive testing!
We will use many more testcases when we grade!

Overall Grade: NO GRADE YET
