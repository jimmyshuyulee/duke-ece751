In this assignment you will write a new version
of the standard library function 'printf' using a
template parameter pack. The only difference is instead
of using the '%' identifier to indicate a positional
argument you will use '$'.

We have provided definitions for the two functions you
will need to implement. These definition serve as a 
strong hint toward what you should be doing.
