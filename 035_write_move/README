In this assignment we will be expanding upon the
IPAddress class you saw in read_move2. We have extended
it to include two additional classes, Header and Packet.

Implement the copy constructor, move constructor and move
assignment operator for these two classes. The code in main
should then compile and run if done correctly. Do not modify
main.

Submit your code.cpp for grading.
