In lambda.cpp we've provided some function definitions
for some tasks that are well suited to lambdas. We have told you
which std::algorithm function is most appropriate for
each TODO. Your job is to use that function with an
associated lambda to accomplish this task. The code in
main should run and do what you would expect.

There are 4 TODOs, each specified in lambda.cpp. Complete
all 4 and submit your code. Run 'make' to build the code.
