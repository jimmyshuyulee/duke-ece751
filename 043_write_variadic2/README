In this assignment you will be utilizing C++14 type deduction features to implement
a different type of variadic template than the print you have done in the previous
assignment. The idea is that you can compose multiple functions together, like in the
example below

function_1: x = x * 2
function_2: x = x + 10
function_3: x = x - 5

compose(function_1, function_2)(5)
--> function_1: 5 * 2 = 10
--> function_2: 10 + 10 = 20
--> function_3: 20 - 5 = 15
--> result: 15

In compose.cpp you will see two functions that must be filled in to implement this, along
with a main method to test. As with the previous assignment, the first function is the 'base case'.
