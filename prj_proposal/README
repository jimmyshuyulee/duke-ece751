For your final project in this course, you will propose and implement
a program that solves an interesting and meaningful problem of your
choosing. 

We want you to use what you have learned this semester to do an
excellent job planning, using abstration, and testing your code. In
addition, your program should:
- use good practices for C++ 11,
- use at least one form of polymorphism,
- create multiple classes,
- use STL members where applicable,
- accept input from cin or a file (as appropriate),
- produce some output, either to stdout or a file (as appropriate), and
- perform some kind of significant computation.  

Inspiration can come from your future career goals, a personal pet
project, ongoing research, etc. For example, a student in
computational mechanics might write a mesh generator or finite element
analysis tool. You could also implement a type of program mentioned in
AoP, such as task scheduling or resource allocation.

The scale of this program should be significant but reasonable to
complete in three weeks. Choose something you find interesting and
won't mind spending many hours on!

You should also document your project well. We should be able to
quickly read about the interface of your program. You should provide a
test suite and instructions for how to test your program. The program
must be able to run on the 751 server without installing anything
additional. 

The grading breakdown will be as follows:
-  5% project proposal
- 25% code quality
      o abstraction
      o documentation
      o formatting
- 40% functionality
      o sophistication of problem
      o robustness to various inputs
      o no memory leaks
- 30% testing
      o documentation of test cases
      o thoroughness of test cases

To help you scale your project, you should tell us in advance what you
are planning to do, so we can give you feedback on what is reasonable
in this time frame. For the proposal, please submit a file
proposal.txt that includes the following information:
- Title of your project
- Paragraph summarizing the goal of your project
- Interface specification
- Testing plan
- Breakdown of project into 3-5 steps and how long you expect each one
  to take
- Sources of required domain knowledge

The proposal is worth 5% of the project grade, and you must include
all of the above components for full credit.
