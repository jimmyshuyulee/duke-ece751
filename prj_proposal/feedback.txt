Feedback:
I'm very concerned that your domain knowledge is a github repo that
already does this.  That sounds very dangerous in terms of isolating
your work from their work. Do you have alternative sources of domain
knowledge? 

Otherwise, this sounds ok.

I would also create a more descriptive title that doesn't include
"Apache Airflow."
