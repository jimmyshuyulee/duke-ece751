The following two assignments are intended to instroduce
you to a new kind of reference available in C++11 called
an rvalue reference. An rvalue reference allows you to bind
a mutable reference to an rvalue but not an lvalue. This 
is useful in indicating whether or not an object is temporary.

Consider the code in the enclosed file, "code.cpp".
This code is designed to illustrate the difference
between a standard lvalue reference and an rvalue 
reference.

What would the output of the code be?
Put the output in a file called "answer.txt"
